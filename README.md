# Rancid Tomatillos
-------
### Overview

Rancid Tomatillos is an interactive webpage that allows users to browse a collection of many popular movies. Our application also has features that allows the user to view all top rated movies as well as browse by genre in order to help them decide what to watch. Further, the user is also able to click each movie to see more details including the movie's tagline, overview, rating, release date, genre(s), and runtime as well as budget and box office figures.

This was a paired [project](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html) and is built using React, React Router, JavaScript, CSS, and utilizes Test Driven Developement and End-to-End testing with Cypress.

- The user can visit the home page to view both top rated movies and all movies all at once
- The user can also use the dropdown menu and select a specific genre which will display all movies of that genre
- The user can select a movie which will take them to a new page that displays the movie's details
- At any time, the user can click the page title to return to the homepage
